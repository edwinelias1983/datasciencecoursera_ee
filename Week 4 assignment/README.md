**INTRODUCTION **

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

**CONTENT** 

1.**README.md** provides an a brief overview of the content of each file.

2.**CodeBook.md** describes the variables, data, and other revelant information.

3.**tidyData.txt**: is a tidy data set 

4.**tidymeanData.txt**: is a tidy data set with the mean and standard deviation performed on all variables.

5.**run_analysis.R**: that performs the follwing:

  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each      variable for each activity and each subject.
